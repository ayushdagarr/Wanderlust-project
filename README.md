# Wanderlust-project

Wanderlust is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb that allows users to explore, create, and review travel destinations around the world.
It features user authentication, cloud-based image uploads, and an interactive map for location visualization.

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and EJS), this project demonstrates my ability to develop secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.
